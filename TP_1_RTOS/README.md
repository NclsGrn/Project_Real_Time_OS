# Realisation of RTOS Labs in Embedded System

## FreeRTOS, Task and Semaphores

Initiate project on CubeMX with USART1 pin PB7 and PA9 for transmission and reception on USART1. Autorise HSE with crystal oscillator and set the clock config on HSE and 216 MHz for the working frequency. Using LSE is possible but less precise.

The first thing to do is to enable printf rewriting because this is going to be used a lot during the Lab.
